## Welcome to Jake's Mobile Application Development site

This site is dedicated to discussing mobile application development using Qt5 with QML

### What is Qt5

Qt5 is the latest release of the Qt libraries from the Qt company originally developed by the Trolltech company.

These libraries are a set of C++ libraries designed to improve cross plateform development, i.e. using the Qt libraries allows developers to produce code that can easierly be compiled to different operating systems.

One set of code can be compiled to either a Linux, Windows, Android, or even iOS plateforms.
